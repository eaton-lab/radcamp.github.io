## **What to do if the notebook is not working**
This **WILL** happen to everyone at least once, probably many times. You 
attempt to open your web browser to `http://localhost/<my_port_#>` and 
you see the dreaded:

1) First, ***DO NOT PANIC!***. Randomly clicking stuff is not going to fix the problem.

2) Open a terminal connection to the cluster and **make sure your notebook server is actually running**.

3) **On your laptop** start a new ssh tunnel using the [Windows](https://github.com/radcamp/radcamp.github.io/blob/master/NYC2018/Jupyter_Notebook_Setup.md#windows-ssh-tunnel-configuration) or [mac/linux](https://github.com/radcamp/radcamp.github.io/blob/master/NYC2018/Jupyter_Notebook_Setup.md#maclinux-ssh-tunnel-configuration) directions.

4) In a browser open a new tab and navigate to `http://localhost:<my_port_#>`

5) If it still doesn't work, ask for help.
