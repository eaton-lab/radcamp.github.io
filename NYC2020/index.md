# Welcome to Micro RadCamp 2020 - The New York City Edition

August 5th, 2020  
New York City  

# Summary
In this workshop, we will introduce RADseq assembly, phylogenetic and population
genetic methods, high performance computing, basic unix command line and python
programming, and jupyter notebooks to promote reproducible science. We will introduce ipyrad,
a unified and self-contained RAD-seq assembly and analysis framework, which emphasizes
simplicity, performance, and reproducibility. We will proceed through all the steps necessary to
assemble the RAD-seq data generated in Part I of the workshop. We will introduce both the
command line interface, as this is typically used in high performance computing settings, and the
ipython/jupyter notebook API, which allows researchers to generate documented and easily
reproducible workflows. Additionally, we will mentor participants in using the ipyrad.analysis
API which provides a powerful, simple, and reproducible interface to several widely used
methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships, population structure, and admixture.
