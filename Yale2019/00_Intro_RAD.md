## Why use ipyrad at all?
* Simple: Easy to install, easy to use.
* Resourceful: Documentation, tutorials, cookbooks, and help forums available.
* Reproducible: Promoting the use of Jupyter Notebooks to organize workflows.
* Flexible: API access to functions and data to build custom assemblies.
* Transparent: Providing human readable code and data files.

## Why prefer it to stacks?
* Allow variable length sequences
* Allow for indel variants
* Accomodate PE data coherently
* Multiple reference sequence modes built-in
* Massive parallelization (use as many cores as available)
* Support for more RAD-seq protocols (GBS, 2bRAD, 3RAD, etc)
* ipyrad param file interface and API mode provide a modern UI
