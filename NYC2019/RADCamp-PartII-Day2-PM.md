## Small group work focused on the pilot datasets
Break into groups around real data with the intention of running a few analyses,
creating some plots and reporting the results to the rest of the group.

Results should be put in a google slides presentation in the [RADCamp google
drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nvu6n1PSS5OETiwievADpWEyu-xNbBV2).

## Brief presentation of results of small group analysis
Please create a brief presentation (1-2 slides max) to highlight any interesting
results you might have obtained in the [Google Drive folder for draft results slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nvu6n1PSS5OETiwievADpWEyu-xNbBV2?usp=sharing).

## Wrap-up & adjourn
Put stuff here.
