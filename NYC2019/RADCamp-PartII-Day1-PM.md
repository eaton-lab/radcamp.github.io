## ipyrad CLI simulated data assembly Part II
Lead: Isaac

[ipyrad CLI Part II](03_ipyrad_partII_CLI.md)

## Coffee breaky

## Look at the real data we generated
Lead: Deren

* Now we will move to the real data
 * Covering i7 demultiplexing (Mostly a lecture based thing, w/ an introduction to API mode).
 * Show some results from the real demux process.

## Form groups and assemble real data
Last hour at the end of the 1st day. Form the groups at the end of the day
organized around the 16 new datasets. Get params files for the real data and
fire off the ipyrad assemblies on google cloud instances (needs to be set up).
