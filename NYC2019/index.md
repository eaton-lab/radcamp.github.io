# Registration

Participation will be limited to 30 individuals. Registration for this edition
of RADCamp has not yet been decided, but it will cover coffee and light snacks
for the days of the workshop. The registration fee is more of an inducement to prevent
people from signing up and then flaking, so __nobody will be turned away for
lack of funding.__ If you want to request a fee waiver please contact the
organizers.

__Registration is not yet available. Stay tuned__
