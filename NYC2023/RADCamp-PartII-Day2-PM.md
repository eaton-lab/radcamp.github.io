# RADCamp NYC 2023 Part II (Bioinformatics)
# Day 2 (PM)

## Overview of the afternoon activities:
* [Small group work focused on the pilot datasets](#Small-group-work-focused-on-the-pilot-datasets)
* Analysis breakout rooms 1
* Coffee Break
* Analysis breakout rooms 2
* [Group presentation](#presentation-of-results-of-small-group-analysis)
* [Wrap-up & adjourn](#wrap-up-&-adjourn)

## Small group work focused on the pilot datasets
Lead: Isaac (20')

Break into groups around real data with the intention of running a few analyses,
creating some plots and reporting the results to the rest of the group.
* Assign one group member to lead/coordinate analysis and to update the results slides.
* Ideally, everyone will run every type of analysis. But there is limited time.
So each person will instead choose one analysis to run first, and can do other
analyses after if they have time.
* Assign analyses to participants/groups with the plan to complete 2-3 analyses by end of day.

Results should be put in the google slides presentation in the [RADCamp google
drive folder](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDYFz-l4UNr2m0rhXbsU3iKJjTTUGky9qGfENfCoBRQ/edit#slide=id.p).

## Analysis breakout rooms 1
Lead: All (60')

Instructors will rotate among groups during this time to make sure everyone is making progress.

## Coffee break (2:30-3:00)

## Analysis breakout room 2 (synthesize the results)
Lead: All (60')

* Groups meetup, some analyses can continue running. Decide what will finish in time.
* Enter finished results into the slideshow, discuss their meaning together.
* Coordinate on updating the [results presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDYFz-l4UNr2m0rhXbsU3iKJjTTUGky9qGfENfCoBRQ/edit#slide=id.p)

## Presentation of results of small group analysis
Please update the brief presentation (1-2 slides max) to highlight any interesting
results you might have obtained in the [Google Drive folder for draft results slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDYFz-l4UNr2m0rhXbsU3iKJjTTUGky9qGfENfCoBRQ/edit#slide=id.p).


## Wrap-up & adjourn
Put stuff here.
