Activities we'll cover this morning:

* [Connecting to the cluster](#ssh-intro): [Windows](#ssh-for-windows)/[Mac/linux](#ssh-for-mac)
* [Basic command line navigation](#command-line-basics)
* [Fetching the data](#fetch-the-raw-data)
* [Basic quality control (FastQC)](#fastqc-for-quality-control)

# Stuff We want people to know about the cluster

```sh
echo "this is how you make something look like a command
```
# SSH Intro

## SSH for windows
Windows computers need to use a 3rd party app for connecting to remote computers. The best app for this in my experience is [puTTY](https://www.putty.org/), a free SSH client. Right click and "Save link as" on the [64-bit binary executable link](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe).
